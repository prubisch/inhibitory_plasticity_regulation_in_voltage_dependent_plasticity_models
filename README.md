# inhibitory_plasticity_regulation_in_voltage_dependent_plasticity_models

This repository holds all code and data to reproduce the figures of "The trade-off between temporal precision and effect amplitude of inhibitory plasticity regulation determines separability of learned representations" also renamed  "The role of temporal sensitivity of synaptic plasticity in representation learning" (Rubisch et al., 2024).
The directory "simulation_results" holds all simulation results from long experiments, we do not recommend to run locally. Those include results for Figures 2, 5, 6 and 12. 
The protocols for each model of the bars-and-stripes as well as the receptive field simulation can be found in their respectively named directories. Similarly the notebook "plot_functional_figures" uses the saved data to plot Figure 5,6 and 12. 

Please note that all schema and circuit diagrams (subfigure A) have been added with inkscape after generating the .pdf in the notebooks.
