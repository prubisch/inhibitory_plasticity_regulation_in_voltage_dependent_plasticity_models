# inhibitory_plasticity_regulation_in_voltage_dependent_plasticity_models

This repository holds all code and data to reproduce the figures of "The trade-off between temporal precision and effect amplitude of inhibitory plasticity regulation determines separability of learned representations" (Rubisch et al., 2024).
Simulation results are provided along the simulation protocols for experiments which take a significant time to run. Those are :
